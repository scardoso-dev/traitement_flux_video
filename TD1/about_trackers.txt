Description :

- BOOSTING Tracker: Based on the same algorithm used to power the machine learning behind Haar cascades (AdaBoost), but like Haar cascades, is over a decade old. This tracker is slow and doesn’t work very well. Interesting only for legacy reasons and comparing other algorithms. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
- MIL Tracker: Better accuracy than BOOSTING tracker but does a poor job of reporting failure. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
- KCF Tracker: Kernelized Correlation Filters. Faster than BOOSTING and MIL. Similar to MIL and KCF, does not handle full occlusion well. (minimum OpenCV 3.1.0)
- CSRT Tracker: Discriminative Correlation Filter (with Channel and Spatial Reliability). Tends to be more accurate than KCF but slightly slower. (minimum OpenCV 3.4.2)
- MedianFlow Tracker: Does a nice job reporting failures; however, if there is too large of a jump in motion, such as fast moving objects, or objects that change quickly in their appearance, the model will fail. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
- TLD Tracker: I’m not sure if there is a problem with the OpenCV implementation of the TLD tracker or the actual algorithm itself, but the TLD tracker was incredibly prone to false-positives. I do not recommend using this OpenCV object tracker. (minimum OpenCV 3.0.0)
- MOSSE Tracker: Very, very fast. Not as accurate as CSRT or KCF but a good choice if you need pure speed. (minimum OpenCV 3.4.1)
